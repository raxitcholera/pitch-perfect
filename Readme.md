Welcome to PitchPerfect!
===================

This is an iOS app that records and plays audio using various filters like reverb and echo. 

Utilized the AVFoundation framework for audio recording, playback, and effects.

----------

**Note: Please run the program using the PitchPerfect.xcodeproj file.**

Use Case
-------------
- Open the application and hit the record button.
- When done recording hit the stop button to move to the next step.
- On the next screen you would be able to playback the audio with different effects.

Future Work
-------------

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Store the recording into core data

Implement a feature that helps the user save the recording and the effect that they find funny into the app to revisit on a later time.

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Share the recording with friends

Implement the share option to help the user share something funny with friends.
